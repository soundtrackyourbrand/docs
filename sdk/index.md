## Introduction

The Soundtrack SDK enables you to build support for Soundtrack on your platform. By combining expert curation and world-class tech, Soundtrack Your Brand provides a beautiful all-in-one solution for streaming music to stores, hotels, restaurants, and other commercial settings.

The SDK is available for selected partners. If you're interested in becoming one, please reach out to sdk@soundtrackyourbrand.com (applications currently open for opportunities of more than 5000 locations).

This page contains the documentation for the SDK. In order to use it, you will need our latest build (which we need to send to you).

Soundtrack SDK is the package containing all code and documentation needed for you to get started. Splayer API is the local API within the SDK, used for initiating and controlling playback.

Unless anything else is communicated by Soundtrack, the application shall be named "0Soundtrack Player".

### Features
* Static and shared libraries (dynamic)
* Few entry points which means faster load times and simple mapping both for dynamic and static linking
* Extendable API without the need to recompile (unless there are breaking changes)
* Callbacks for audio so the user can control their hardware specific needs.

### Functionality
* Create and free a Splayer API context
* Exit the player gracefully (after the next song)
* Player control (play, pause, skip track, set volume)
* Checklist for common troubles
* Callbacks for audio so the user can control their hardware specific needs (eg. ALSA)

### Responsibilities
* Soundtrack is responsible for the binary and header file (eg libsplayer-x.so and splayerapi-x.h).
* Splayer communicates with Soundtrack's infrastructure and delivers sound buffers (eg. PCM data).
* Partner is responsible for all the parts concerning the executable, the actual playback (eg. ALSA).
* Soundtrack provides source code examples as-is and it's the Partners responsibility to make them work.
* Partner can use any part of the source code example, change and modify them, except splayerapi-x.h
* Partner is responsible to check with Soundtrack's infrastructure every 15 minutes to see if new releases are available.
* Partner is responsible for providing a toolchain that supports a C++ standard that is at most 5 years old at any given time now and in the future.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have:
* your vendor secret (provided to you by Soundtrack).
* your Partner API credentials (provided to you by Soundtrack).
* access to Soundtrack. Sign up at soundtrackyourbrand.com.
* the Splayer API header file (e.g. splayer-2.h) and the Splayer shared library (eg. libsplayer-1.so, libsplayer-1.dylib).

All applications must be in line with the terms & conditions and be certified by Soundtrack (see certification criteria further down on this page).

### What's in the package?
* Header files for Splayer API and ALSA implementation example
* Shared library for Splayer API
* Example implementations for audio output via ALSA or Darwin
* Example source code using ALSA or Darwin
* Example source code using the update service to fetch latest shared library

Note: The package can't be find on this page. It will be sent to you by Soundtrack. A static library version can be provided. It is not included by default due to the increase in size of the package

### Soundtrack - Overview
We highly recommend that you play around with your Soundtrack account so you get an overview of the product prior to using the API. All guides and frequently asked questions regarding Soundtrack can be found on our help pages.

It’s extra important that you understand the hierarchy, where one **account** (e.g. “Ludwig's Burgers”) can have multiple **locations** (e.g. “Flagship restaurant, Stockholm”) which in turn can have multiple **sound zones** (e.g. “Bar”, “Restaurant area”, “Staff room”).

Each sound zone can only have one **device**. Soundtrack supports multiple device types (see our help pages to see which ones). The rationale for having multiple sound zones is that you want different music in different parts of the same location. If you want the same music everywhere in the same location you’ll only need one device and then distribute the music with your audio system.

### Create a device

Before we can run an application using the SDK we must create a device using the Partner API. This device will be unique and needs to be paired to a sound zone. A device can only be paired with one sound zone at a time. The Partner API is a GraphQL API and you can run the following to create a device. Note: you need your Partner API credentials to do this step. It only needs to be done once since the pairing code does not change.

1. Go to https://partner.soundtrackyourbrand.com/api/explore (this is just an explore tool, you should of course implement this code where you find it suitable)
2. Add the Authorization header. In the “Value” field, write “Basic <your_credentials>” where <your_credentials> are the Partner API credentials that you should have received from Soundtrack. Ensure that you copy the full base64-token including the == on the end.
3. Enter a GraphQL query in the top box
```
mutation PartnerCodeCreator($input:GeneratePairingCodesInput!){
    generatePairingCodes(input: $input) {
        codes {
            pairingCode
        }
    }
}
```
4. Include the query variables
```
{   
    "input": {
        "description":"ARM64",
        "deviceType": "EMBEDDED",
        "label": "Partnername M324",
        "hardwareIds": ["partner_id_ab12"]
    }
}
```
 * Change the description to add information about the platform (will not be shown to users)
 * Set deviceType to `EMBEDDED` (currently not optional)
 * Change the label to the product's name (will be shown to users)
 * Change the hardwareIds entry to the hardware_id of your choice. See "Authentication & Pairing" for more info


5. Run the query and you should get a pairing code as output. You will need this code to pair the created device with a specific sound zone later.
6. Write down the hardware_id that you chose (in the example ‘partner_id_ab12’). Write down the pairing code that was output when you ran the query

### Pairing a device with a sound zone
1. Go to Soundtrack (https://www.soundtrackyourbrand.com/)
2. Press “Locations”
3. If you have no location set up. Create location using the “Add Location” button
4. When the location is created, you need to create a sound zone
5. Press the options button to the right of the location
6. Add a zone with a name
7. Click on the new zone
8. Pair your player application by choosing “Hardware Device”
9. In the input field, enter the Pairing Code that you got when creating a device.
10. The device should now be paired with this sound zone.

### Building and running the example code
1. Unpack tar ball (sent to you by Soundtrack)
2. In the /src folder there are several examples showcasing some basic setup of a player application
3. Open any example file, and change the parameter: hardware_id to the hardware id you created in the “Create a device” section (“partner_id_ab12” in above example)
4. We also need to provide the vendor secret to the application (will be sent to you by Soundtrack). This can be done in a few different ways:
 * Set the value directly in vendor_secret
 * Set `-DVENDOR_SECRET=xxxx` when building with cmake
 * Add the vendor secret directly in the CMakeList.txt file
 ```c
 add_definitions(-DVENDOR_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
 ```
5. Build the project using cmake
6. There will now be several example targets in the build root folder
7. Run the example executable (eg. libsplayer_simple)
8. There should be some console output and music should start playing shortly

```c
libsplayer_alsa
is_playing() = false


alsa_open samp: 44100 channels: 2
Alsa initialized, buffer_size: 88200 period_size: 22050
Couldn't find PCM 'PCM' volume control.
alsa_audio_impl::audio_pause: 0

 alsa_audio_impl::audio_pause: 0

```

## Reference implementation
In the package distributed by SYB, you will find an array of example implementations. Feel free to modify as you wish.

## Authentication & Pairing

Splayer API is only aware of Vendor Hardware ID, which is something that you as a vendor chose, and a Vendor Secret that you will get from Soundtrack. The hardware ID is used to generate the Device ID in the Partner API (see Create a Device above). The reason Soundtrack Device ID's are used for pairing is because they are guaranteed to be unique, even though two vendors might have the same Vendor Hardware ID for two different devices. This way we avoid name clashes for devices.

Second reason, is that our website is open for all customers, which means a user can have devices from multiple vendors and the end user would then need to pick from a list of vendor. It wouldn't be the best user experience, it would be easy to make mistakes and the user himself could guess a Vendor Hardware ID and do a denial of service for somebody else.

## Upgrade and provisioning
Splayer API is provisioned by Soundtrack's backoffice systems with rollout limited to a certain percent of all devices, or at a certain time of day considering local time zone of the device. Below are two different endpoints to use to retrieve the latest version of Splayer API for two different platforms (Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit, Ubuntu 16.04 32 bit).

* https://builds.soundtrackyourbrand.com/remote/splayer-x86_64/latest
* https://builds.soundtrackyourbrand.com/remote/splayer-i686/latest

```json
{
"id": "QnVpbGQsLDFrOTdhZm1jdzc0Lw..",
"iso8601_created_at": "2017-11-30T11:24:43.805244Z",
"created_by": "",
"iso8601_updated_at": "2017-11-30T11:32:54.062388Z",
"updated_by": "VXNlciwsMWppbHR4bWwwamsv",
"remote_addr": "",
"user_agent": "",
"version": "3f69b075cd",
"link": "https://download.api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/ci-releases/splayer-i686/libsplayer-splayerapi-3f69b075cd_i686.so",
"checksum": "6482a6cdf959af43fe921a22025bacb32543acb0",
"type": "splayer_api",
"platform": "splayer-i686",
"auto_promote": true,
"status": "released"
}
```

The two important fields are version and link, you can disregard all other fields in the JSON. In the example above the version is hashnumber, since the example is not from a proper release, but the latest build. The link points directly to the library.

The checksum is a sha1 hash of he file in the link, make sure to verify the checksum matches for security and reliability reason!

To get provisioning working you need to send three HTTP headers. Basically each device sends a Vendor Hardware ID as described above and a Device Vendor ID. In the example below the Vendor Hardware ID is `28cfe91fcc6d`.

```
X-Device-Key-0:eth0
X-Device-Id-0:28cfe91fcc6d
X-Device-Vendor:your_vendor_ID
```

**Example of adding HTTP headers with cURL**

```c
char buf[1024];
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "X-Device-Id-0:%s", device_id);

struct curl_slist *chunk = NULL;
chunk = curl_slist_append(chunk, "Accept:");
chunk = curl_slist_append(chunk, "X-Device-Key-0:eth0");
chunk = curl_slist_append(chunk, buf);
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, chunk);
```

## Approval process and certification
The application built is to be approved by Soundtrack and shall at all times adhere to the certification criterias (see: Certification).

## Release management
Please note that the below release information relates to the player software within the SDK, so it's not the SDK and the splayer-APIs per se.

### Release SDK player software
The player software is updated monthly according to a set schedule. Unless anything else is communicated the release will be done on a Wednesday between 02.00 and 06.00 (based on each player’s local time).
* Wednesday:
 * Your internal test account will be updated
 * From this day, you have one week to flag any issues to Soundtrack. Soundtrack will decide whether or not the issue is a blocker
* Wednesday, one week later:
 * The same release version is sent to 100% of your customer base (unless any blocking issues were found during testing)

### Patching SDK player software
Every Thursday Soundtrack decides if there is a need for a patch the coming week. The reason for a patch is either an incident or an important bug.

* Important bugs are classified as something that has direct customer impact, such as audio playback issues, UI bugs or irregular data consumption. Fixes are mostly small and should not affect major parts of the code
* An incident is when a back-end change may or have already happened, that we will or want to protect us from

All times below are CET/CEST. Consider that the times below are deadlines.

* No later than Thursday, 18:00:
 * Your internal test account will be updated with the patch version
 * We will send you an email to the designated address
* No later than Tuesday, 15:00:
 * Soundtrack Test Lead decides if the patch can be released
 * If no-go: email to you informing about the decision
 * If you have had the time to test and approve (via email): patch is released in the next morning
 * If we have not heard from you, we will not do the release to your customers

If you did not get in touch with us, you will have to wait until next full release to get the patch.

## Q&A

### Older version of libstdc++ and ld.so running on the target.
Depending on GCC version you might have an older version of libc, libstdc++ and ld. We are running GCC 6.4 and 7.0 in production.
```
./libSplayer_alsa: /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by libSplayer.so)
./libSplayer_alsa: /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by libSplayer.so)
./libSplayer_alsa: /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.19' not found (required by libSplayer.so)
./libSplayer_alsa: /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by libSplayer.so)
```
If needed we can link libstdc++ statically to avoid most of the issues, but your target platform needs a compatible libc.so (glibc). Use the same version of libc and libstdc++ on your target as in the toolchain that you provide us. For Linux, you can create them using Yocto or Buildroot. Be aware that we are using atomics from c++ 11, and some gcc toolchains put these in a separate library called libatomic.so. This library is required on the device for our player to run.

### Audio stutters
On some hardware we have seen ALSA defaulting to a very small buffer size. A 44.1Khz two channel PCM stream is 88 200 samples/per second. In the below example that's a context switch 200 times a second (every 5ms). Now a small buffer size is great for low latency, game and sound applications where instant sound feedback is needed on user input. This is not the case for audio streaming. With these small buffers we can't feed ALSA with audio fast enough, so we will get -EPIPE from snd_pcm_writei().
```
Alsa initialized, buffer_size: 1323 period_size: 441
```
Set the ALSA buffer size to at least 1 period (second). For 44.1Khz two channel PCM stream is buffer size 88 200 samples and a period size of 22 050 samples. We have provided the code in callbacks_alsa.c. You could try to set the buffer size to 4 periods instead.
```
Alsa initialized, buffer_size: 88200 period_size: 22050
```

## Certification

### Background
* The below is applicable to the Soundtrack SDK, not the Soundtrack API
* All applications built using the Soundtrack SDK are to be certified by Soundtrack prior to being shared with customers
* In order to conduct the certification, you need, in addition to the credentials used in the SDK, a Soundtrack test account (subject to Soundtrack T&C and provided by Soundtrack)
* The certification process is developed from a customer experience standpoint. Ease of use is critical

### Definitions
* **Pair** is Soundtrack lingo for connecting the Application with Soundtrack using the Device ID
* **Device ID** is the Soundtrack generated ID needed for pairing the Application with Soundtrack's services
* **SDK** is the APIs and binaries provided by Soundtrack
* **Application** is the partner built application that contains the SDK

### Certification process
* Please note that you need to provide Soundtrack with two pcs of the hardware in order for Soundtrack to do the certification
* Any changes to the hardware will prompt a new certification process
* All tests should pass on a 0.5 Mbps network, unless anything else is stated in the instructions
* The partner shall recommend an SD-card to it's client (unless internal storage is used). The same SD-card shall be used for the certification
* The certification shall be as close to the real environment as possible, so if the platform's normal state is e.g. to have two other applications running at the same time, these shall be running during the certification as well

Type | Test case | Instructions | Expected behaviour
